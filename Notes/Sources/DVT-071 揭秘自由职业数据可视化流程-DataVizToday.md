### 1 首次接触/邮件等

- 快速回复
- 问题清单
	- timeline
	- budget
	- specific deliveriables
		- who is the audience
		- what do you want them to do
		- what's the key message
		- where are they gonna see this work
			- at their desk digesting it
			- social media it will be scrolled past in half a second
			- something on a website or in a magazine

### 2 如何确定收费标准

- 找社群看看他们怎么定价，并逐渐调整
- 询问预算 80-90% 的客户其实都有预算，通过预算来考虑方案
- 控制小项目等比例
- 学会拒绝项目
- 如果项目和自己的价值观不搭，得加钱。。。
- should you charge hourly rate or should you charge project based rate?
	- 尽量选择项目形式
- 不同对项目可能有不同对收费，比如 一家美国大型零售巨头 vs一家小型环保慈善机构
- you have more time to be working on creative projects that then bring in more well paying projects 创意性项目能够带来更多的合作
