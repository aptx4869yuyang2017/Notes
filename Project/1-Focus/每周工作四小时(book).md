### 下错火车

 **Being financially rich** and having the ability to live like a millionaire are fundamentally two very different things.
经济上富有和有能力像百万富翁一样生活从根本上来说是两件截然不同的事情。


Money is multiplied in practical value depending on the number of W’s you control in your life: **what you do, when you do it, where you do it, and with whom you do it.** I call this the “**freedom multiplier**.”
经济上富有和有能力像百万富翁一样生活从根本上来说是两件截然不同的事情。


> [!important] Options
> Options—the ability to choose—is real power. This book is all about **how to see and create those options with the least effort and cost**. It just so happens, paradoxically, that you can make more money—a lot more money—by doing half of what you are doing now.
> 选择——选择的能力——才是真正的力量。本书讲述的是如何以最少的努力和成本来查看和创建这些选项。矛盾的是，你可以通过做现在所做的一半来赚更多的钱——更多的钱。
